# BowlingScoreboard
This project allows the user to enter the score for a single game of bowling frame by frame and displays the final scoreboard.


## General Information

Strike = 10 pins hit all at once.
Spare = 10 pins hit in 2 attempts.
Otherwise score of frame is the combined total of the 2 attempts. 

Strike bonus: 10 + score of next 2 attempts.
